# Compiler Optimization: A Study of the Pipeline from Programming Languages to Assembly

Our Computer Architecture final project was focused on understanding the transition from high level languages to the assembly programs we learned about in the course. Our goal was to implement a Java to C compiler as well as a C to assembly compiler. Check out our website for a full description of what we learned about compilers and our implementation: 

Check out our presentation for a summary of our learning and implementation:

To run our Java compiler:

Navigate to the pycparserReal folder\s

Run 
```
sudo python setup.py install
```
Navigate to the examples folder\s
Run
```
sudo python setup2.py install
```
Run
```
python symbols.py exampleFunc.java
```
